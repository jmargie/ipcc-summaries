          "question": "What are the two main factors that influence changes in extreme precipitation, and how do they impact it at a global and regional scale?",
          "answer": "The two main factors influencing changes in extreme precipitation are thermodynamic and dynamic processes. At a global scale, increased atmospheric water-holding capacity due to warming (thermodynamic change) leads to more extreme precipitation, following the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. At a regional scale, dynamic changes, such as large-scale modes of variability and local land-use changes, further modulate these extremes, causing variations in regional patterns."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does urbanization affect heavy precipitation, and what are some mechanisms through which this occurs?",
          "answer": "Urbanization contributes to the intensification of heavy precipitation, particularly in the afternoon and early evening. This occurs through mechanisms such as increased atmospheric moisture from urban heat islands, enhanced condensation due to urban aerosol emissions, pollution affecting cloud microphysics, and urban structures impacting atmospheric motion, all of which lead to locally intensified precipitation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is there low confidence in identifying long-term trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation at the global scale?",
          "answer": "There is low confidence in identifying long-term trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation globally due to sporadic spatial coverage and limited length of available data records. Additionally, the existing data records are often not long enough to robustly quantify past changes, and regional studies show mixed results, making it challenging to establish a consistent global pattern."

          "options": [
            "a. Future projections of precipitation extremes are highly certain, primarily due to the consistent changes in atmospheric aerosols.",
            "b. The uncertainty in future projections of precipitation extremes is largely due to the unknown future changes in large-scale modes of variability and local factors like urbanization and land-use change.",
