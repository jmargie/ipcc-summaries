The document provides a comprehensive assessment of changes in heavy precipitation on global and regional scales, focusing mainly on extreme precipitation events at various durations. It highlights two primary mechanisms and drivers behind the changes: thermodynamic effects (increased atmospheric water-holding capacity due to warming, following the Clausius-Clapeyron relation) and dynamic processes (large-scale modes of variability like NAO, ENSO, etc.). The document discusses the uncertainty in separating effects of global warming from internal variability and emphasizes the role of regional factors like changes in sea surface temperatures, aerosols, and urbanization in affecting extreme precipitation patterns.

Observed trends show an increase in heavy precipitation events over the mid-20th century across several global regions, though with regional and temporal variations. Data indicates significant increases in extreme daily and five-day precipitation events over global land areas, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia, where data is more abundant. Sub-daily extreme precipitation evidence is less robust due to limited data. On most continents, there have been indications of intensified extreme precipitation with notable increases in regions such as Southern Africa, East Africa, most parts of Asia, South-Eastern South America, and Europe since the 1950s. However, there is low confidence in sub-daily precipitation trends and in some regions due to limited data. Overall, there is a consensus that heavy precipitation events have likely increased over many global land areas since the mid-20th century.
