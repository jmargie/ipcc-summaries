prompt: Write a comparative summary of these two documents, aimed at college-educated readers who are not scientists. make sure to mention details which are only in one document:
The two documents provide insights into the impact of climate change on agricultural and food production systems, focusing particularly on risk projections and observed impacts.

### Projected Risks to Agriculture (First Text)
This document emphasizes the various risks climate change poses to agriculture, highlighting increased irrigation demand and the vulnerabilities of rain-fed agriculture. It projects crop yield reductions, particularly for wheat and rice, and notes the potential losses in livestock and fisheries sectors. Key projections indicate significant yield losses by 2100 under various climate scenarios, such as RCP8.5, which foresee temperature and precipitation changes leading to up to 32% yield reductions. It also anticipates that regions dependent on snowmelt will face water scarcity, an issue exacerbated by increased irrigation demands due to climate factors and population growth. Flooding risks are expected to notably impact agricultural outputs in Europe and Asia, leading to increased damage and economic losses.

Furthermore, it discusses the importance of irrigation as an adaptation measure despite projected limitations in some regions. Elevated CO2 levels are mentioned for their potential to improve water-use efficiency in crops, although with some ambiguity in overall effects. The document stresses the critical role of climate change in exacerbating food insecurity by impacting food availability, safety, and nutrition, with increased malnourishment and hunger projected, particularly in Africa and Asia.

### Observed Impacts on Food Production Systems (Second Text)
This document focuses on the challenges in isolating climate change impacts from non-climatic factors such as technology and irrigation improvements. It provides medium-confidence evidence that climate trends have reduced wheat and maize production globally, with smaller impacts on rice and soybeans. High-latitude regions like northeast China have benefitted from warming, which has expanded suitable areas for agriculture. However, the attribution of climate change impacts is complicated by non-climate factors, though global warming trends have had noticeable effects.

For fisheries, changes in ocean temperatures have led to shifts in fish populations, affecting both marine and inland fisheries. The document highlights studies indicating that climate change has influenced fishery yields in regions like the Northeast Atlantic and Southeast Australia. Coral reef ecosystems, crucial for fish habitats, face severe threats from rising ocean temperatures. Despite limited evidence linking climate change directly to food security, price fluctuations are believed to be influenced by climate-induced supply changes. 

### Comparisons and Unique Points
Both texts emphasize the vulnerabilities of global agriculture and food security to climate change, but they differ in focus. The first text concentrates extensively on projected risks, modeling precise future scenarios, and irrigation challenges, while the second text deals with observed impacts, particularly in crop and fisheries production systems, acknowledging the complexities in attribution due to various non-climatic factors.

Uniquely, the first text delves into potential CO2 fertilization benefits and specific irrigation constraints in high-stress regions, projecting future scenarios and proposing adaptation measures. In contrast, the second text more thoroughly discusses the intricacies of detecting and attributing climate impacts, while also detailing observed shifts in fishery distributions and their ramifications.

In summary, the first text provides a forward-looking analysis with model-based projections, whereas the second offers a retrospective assessment of observed impacts against a backdrop of complex environmental and anthropogenic interactions.
