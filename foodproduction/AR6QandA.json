            "question": "How does climate change potentially impact rain-fed versus irrigated agriculture, and what adaptations are suggested to mitigate these impacts?",
            "answer": "Climate change increases the vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture due to increased variability in precipitation and water availability. Irrigated agriculture may face rising water demand due to factors like population growth, land use change, and bio-energy crops. Adaptation strategies include irrigation expansion and enhancement; however, this is limited by water resource constraints, particularly in regions like South and Central Asia. There is potential for some temperate drylands to become more suitable for rain-fed agriculture, although the risks generally increase globally. Additionally, projected increases in irrigation water requirements necessitate finding new water sources as snowmelt contribution declines."
          },
          {
            "question": "Discuss the dual role of elevated CO2 levels on agricultural productivity and water use efficiency, as indicated in the document.",
            "answer": "Elevated CO2 levels have a dual role: they can enhance plant water use efficiency and potentially reduce plant water consumption by 4â€“17%, which may be beneficial in increasing agricultural productivity, particularly for rain-fed C3 crops. However, the effect of CO2 on water use efficiency is not fully captured by current global crop models. Despite these benefits, greater CO2 may also result in increased dependency on irrigation, particularly for economically valuable crops, and may contribute to nutrient dilution in crops, complicating the net benefits."

          {
            "question": "How are regional disparities in hunger risk expected to manifest due to climate change, and which areas are most vulnerable?",
            "answer": "Regional disparities in hunger risk due to climate change are expected to grow, with projections indicating that 80% of the population at risk of hunger will reside in Africa and Asia by 2050. This risk is exacerbated under high-emission scenarios like RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. The increasing frequency and severity of climate events will directly impact food production and access, leading to higher food prices and financial stress on households, further increasing hunger risks in these vulnerable regions."
