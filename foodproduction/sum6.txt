prompt: 'Please summarize the following document:'
The document discusses projected risks to agriculture and associated key risks related to food security under climate change scenarios. Agriculture will face increased vulnerability, with irrigation water demand rising and rain-fed agriculture becoming more susceptible to adverse climate impacts. Global warming risks are higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C, with significant projected declines in crop yields, especially for wheat and rice. Climate change will lead to yield losses due to temperature and precipitation changes, and 11% of croplands could face water scarcity by 2050. Increased drought and flood risks, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia, are anticipated, affecting both crop yields and water consumption.

Irrigation will be the main adaptation response, but water demand is projected to increase substantially, driven by factors such as population growth and bio-energy crop demand. Regions dependent on snowmelt for irrigation will experience decreased water availability, and over 50% of lowlands equipped for irrigation will rely heavily on mountain runoff by 2041-2050.

The document also highlights key risks to food security, safety, and livelihoods. Food insecurity is already high in some regions and will worsen with climate change, which will increase malnourished populations and food prices, affecting access to safe food. Extreme climate events will make current food production areas unsuitable, with 10% of these areas at risk by mid-century. Labor capacity reductions due to heat stress could further undermine food availability.

Climate impacts could increase the number of people at risk of hunger by 2050, with a significant proportion residing in Africa and Asia. Beyond 2050, hunger risks will likely rise, particularly under high-emission scenarios. Climate change will also pose challenges for food safety due to increased pathogen prevalence and toxic bioaccumulation. Food security will be compromised by reduced livelihoods in agriculture, weakened ecosystem services, and policy changes focusing solely on GHG emission reductions without considering their impact on food production.
