      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How do the warming trends in lake surface waters compare with those of sea-surface temperature (SST) according to the document, and what implications might this have for aquatic organisms?",
          "answer": "The warming rates for lake surface waters (0.21°C–0.45°C per decade between 1970 and 2010) have exceeded sea-surface temperature trends (0.09°C per decade between 1980 and 2017). This greater warming of lake surface waters has led to complex changes in the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms, as temperature trends in lakes can vary vertically, horizontally, and seasonally."
        },
        {
          "question": "In what ways are extreme weather events affecting freshwater ecosystems according to the document, and what factors might modulate these impacts?",
          "answer": "Extreme events, such as heat waves, storms, and loss of ice, affect freshwater ecosystems by altering water temperature, level, light, oxygen concentrations, and nutrient dynamics, ultimately impacting primary production, fish communities, and greenhouse gas emissions. These impacts are modified by levels of solar radiation, wind speed, and precipitation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Describe the expected future changes in lake mixing regimes and ice cover due to climate change as projected in the document, and what challenges are associated with these projections.",
          "answer": "Future changes in lake mixing regimes include monomictic lakes becoming permanently stratified and dimictic lakes becoming monomictic by 2080–2100. Ice-covered lakes in the Northern Hemisphere might switch to intermittent ice cover under projections of 3.2°C warming. The challenges in these projections include difficulties in predicting mixing behavior and attributing changes to climate change, compounded by a lack of reliable, long-term hydrologic observations."

            "b) Extreme weather events lead to permanent and irreversible damage.",
