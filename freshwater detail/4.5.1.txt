4.5.1

Projected Risks to Agriculture

AR5 concluded that overall irrigation water demand would increase by
2080, while the vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture will further increase
(Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014). SR1.5 concluded that both the food and
the water sectors would be negatively impacted by global warming
with higher risks at 2°C than at 1.5°C, and these risks could coincide
spatially and temporally, thus increasing hazards, exposures and
vulnerabilities across populations and regions (medium confidence).
SR1.5 further reinforced AR5 conclusions in terms of projected crop
yield reductions, especially for wheat and rice (high confidence), loss of
livestock and increased risks for small-scale fisheries and aquaculture
(medium confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), conclusions which
are further corroborated by SRCCL (Mbow et al., 2019).
Climate change impacts agriculture through various pathways (5.4 –
Crop-based Systems), with projected yield losses of up to 32% by 2100
(RCP8.5) due to the combined effects of temperature and precipitation.
Limiting warming could significantly reduce potential impacts (up 12%
yield reduction by 2100 under RCP4.5) (Ren et al., 2018a). Though
overall changes differ across models, regions and seasons, differences
in impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C can also be identified (Ren et al.,
2018a; Ruane et al., 2018; Schleussner et al., 2018). Globally, 11% (±
5%) of croplands are estimated to be vulnerable to projected climate driven water scarcity by 2050 (Fitton et al., 2019).
Overall drought-driven yield loss is estimated to increase by 9–12%
(wheat), 5.6–6.3% (maize), 18.1–19.4% (rice) and 15.1–16.1%
(soybean) by 2071–2100, relative to 1961–2016 (RCP8.5) (Leng and
Hall, 2019). In addition, temperature-driven increases in water vapour
deficit could have additional negative effects, further exacerbating
drought-induced plant mortality and thus impacting yields (Grossiord
et al., 2020) (see also Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 5 of WGI
report). Currently, global agricultural models do not fully differentiate
crop responses to elevated CO2 under temperature and hydrological
extremes (Deryng et al., 2016) and largely underestimate the effects of
climate extremes (Schewe et al., 2019).
Flood-related risks to agricultural production are projected to increase
over Europe, with a mean increase of expected annual output losses of
approximately €11 million (at 1.5°C GWL); €12 million ( at 2°C GWL)
and €15 million (at 3°C GWL) relative to the 2010 baseline (Koks et al.,
2019). In parts of Asia, where flooding impacts on agriculture are
already significant, projections indicate an increase in damage to area
under paddy by up to 50% in Nepal, 16% in the Philippines, 55% in
Indonesia, 23% in Cambodia and Vietnam and 13% in Thailand (2075–
2099 compared with 1979–2003; RCP8.5) (Shrestha et al., 2019a).
Global crop water consumption of green water resources (soil
moisture) is projected to increase by about 8.5% by 2099 relative to
1971–2000 as a result of climate drivers (RCP6.0), with additional
smaller contributions by land use change (Huang et al., 2019)
(Sections 4.4.1.3, 4.4.8). In India, a substantial increase in green and
blue water consumption is projected for wheat and maize, with a slight
reduction of blue water consumption for paddy fields (Mali et al., 2021).
Temperate drylands, especially higher latitude regions, may become
more suitable for rain-fed agriculture (Bradford et al., 2017). Locally
and regionally, however, some of those areas with currently larger
areas under rain-fed production, for example, in Europe, may become
less suitable for rain-fed agriculture (Table 1 to 4.5.1) (Bradford et al.,
2017; Shahsavari et al., 2019).
While global crop models and estimates of yield impacts often focus
on major staple crops relevant for global food security, crops of high
economic value are projected to become increasingly water dependent.
For example, climate-driven yield increases for tea are projected for
various tea-producing regions if no water limitations and full irrigation
is assumed, but decreases in yields are projected under continued
present-day irrigation assumptions (Beringer et al., 2020). Water-related
impacts on global cotton production are highly dependent on the CO2 fertilisation effect, with increases projected for higher CO2 concentration
if no water limitations are implemented. However, substantial decreases
in cotton production are projected if lower or no fertilisation effects are
accounted for due to increasing water limitations (Jans et al., 2018).
Reductions in economically valuable crops will probably increase the
vulnerability of population groups, especially small-holder farmers with
limited response options (Morel et al., 2019).
To stabilise yields against variations in moisture availability, irrigation
is the often the most common adaptation response (Section 4.6.2,
Box 4.3). Projections indicate a potentially substantial increase in
irrigation water requirements (Boretti and Rosa, 2019). Increasing
agricultural water demand is driven by various factors, including
population growth, increased irrigated agriculture, cropland expansion
and higher demand for bio-energy crops for mitigation (Chaturvedi
et al., 2015; Grafton et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2019; 4.7.6). Depending
on underlying assumptions and the constraints on water resources
implemented in the global agricultural models, irrigation water
requirements are projected to increase two- to three-fold by the end of
the century (Hejazi et al., 2014; Bonsch et al., 2015; Chaturvedi et al.,
2015; Huang et al., 2019). While the combined effects of population
and land use change as well as irrigation expansion account for the
significant part of the projected increases in irrigation water demand
by the end of the century, around 14% of the increase is directly
attributed to climate change (RCP6.0) (Huang et al., 2019).
With various degrees of water stress being experienced under current
conditions and further changes in regional water availability projected,
as well as continuing groundwater depletion as a consequence of
over-abstraction for irrigation purposes (Sections 4.2.6 and 4.4.6),
limitations to major irrigation expansion will occur in some regions,
including South and Central Asia, the Middle East and parts of North and
Central America (Grafton et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2019). Constraining
projections of available irrigation water through consideration of
environmental flow requirements further reduces the potential for
irrigation capacity and expansion (Bonsch et al., 2015). Changes in
land use and production patterns, for example, expansion of rain-fed
production and increasing inter-regional trade, would be required to
meet growing food demand while preserving environmental flow
requirements, though this may increase local food security-related
vulnerabilities (Cross-Chapter Box INTERREG in Chapter 16) (Pastor
et al., 2014). Where climate impacts on yields are not a consequence
of water limitations (mainly for C4 crops), irrigation cannot offset
negative yield impacts (Levis et al., 2018).
Over 50% of the global lowlands equipped for irrigation will depend
heavily on runoff contributions from the mountain cryosphere by
2041–2050 (SSP2–RCP6.0) and are projected to make unsustainable
use of blue water resources (Viviroli et al., 2020). Projected changes in
snowmelt patterns indicate that for all regions dependent on snowmelt
for irrigation during warm seasons, alternative water sources will have
to be found for up to 20% (at 2°C GWL) and up to 40% (at 4°C GWL)
of seasonal irrigation water use, relative to current water use patterns
(1986–2015) (Qin et al., 2020). Regional studies further corroborate
these global findings (Biemans et al., 2019; Malek et al., 2020). Basins
where such alternate sources are not available will face agricultural
water scarcity.
Elevated CO2 concentrations play an important role in determining
future yields in general and have the potential to beneficially affect
plant water use efficiency (Deryng et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2018a;
Nechifor and Winning, 2019). The elevated CO2 effects are projected to
be most prominent for rain-fed C3 crops (Levis et al., 2018). Combined
results from field experiments and global crop models show that CO2
fertilisation could reduce consumptive water use by 4–17% (Deryng
et al., 2016). To account for uncertainties, global agricultural models
provide output with and without account for CO2 fertilisation effects,
though recent progress on reducing model uncertainty indicates that
non-CO2 model runs may no longer be needed for adequate projections
of yield impacts (Toreti et al., 2019).
Due to the complex interactions among determinants for livestock
production, the future signal of water-related risks to this sector is
unclear. Globally, 10% (± 5%) of pasture areas are projected to be
vulnerable to climate-induced water scarcity by 2050 (Fitton et al.,
2019). Water use efficiency gains through elevated CO2 concentrations
have the potential to increase forage quantities, though effects of
nutritional values are ambiguous (Augustine et al., 2018; Derner et al.,
2018; Rolla et al., 2019). In addition, spatial shifts in temperature/
humidity regimes may shift suitable regions for livestock production,
opening up new suitable areas for some regions or encouraging shifts
in specific breeds better adapted to future climatic regimes (Rolla et al.,
2019) (5.5 – Livestock Systems and 5.10 Mixed Systems).
Projections of climate impacts on freshwater aquaculture are limited
(5.9.3.1 – Projected Impacts; Inland freshwater and brackish aquaculture).
In particular, in tropical regions, reductions in water availability,
deteriorating water quality, and increasing water temperatures pose
risks to terrestrial aquaculture, including temperature-related diseases
and endocrine disruption (Kibria et al., 2017, Section 4.4.7). On the
other hand, freshwater aquaculture in temperate and arctic polar
regions may benefit from temperature increases with an extension of
the fish-growing season (Kibria et al., 2017).
Global crop models, which provide the basis for most projections
of agricultural risk, continue to have limitations in resolving water
availability. For example they do not fully resolve the effects of elevated
CO2 for changing water use efficiency (Durand et al., 2018), potentially
overestimating drought impacts on maize yield (Fodor et al., 2017) and
may underestimate limitations to further expansion of irrigation (Elliott
et al., 2014; Frieler et al., 2017b; Winter et al., 2017; Jägermeyr and
Frieler, 2018; Kimball et al., 2019; Yokohata et al., 2020a).
In summary, agricultural water use is projected to increase globally
due to cropland expansion and intensification and climate changeinduced changes in water requirements (high confidence). Parts of
temperate drylands may experience increases in suitability for rainfed production based on mean climate conditions; however, risks to
rain-fed agriculture increase globally because of increasing variability
in precipitation regimes and changes in water availability (high
confidence). Water-related impacts on economically valuable crops will
increase regional economic risks (medium evidence, high agreement).
Regions reliant on snowmelt for irrigation purposes will be affected by
substantial reductions in water availability (high confidence).
