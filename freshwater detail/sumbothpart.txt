prompt: Write a comparative summary of these two documents, aimed at college-educated readers who are not scientists. make sure to mention details which are only in one document:
Both excerpts, AR6 Chapter 2 Section 3 (AR6 Ch2 S3) and AR5 Chapter 3 Section 2 (AR5 Ch3 S2), discuss hydrological changes influenced by climate change, but they emphasize different aspects and scopes of observation. AR6 focuses on observed changes, detection, and attribution related to hydrological patterns and events, such as precipitation, streamflow, and extreme weather. In contrast, AR5 centers on biologically relevant physical shifts in freshwater systems, like thermal habitat changes, water level fluctuations, and ice dynamics.

**Detection and Attribution (AR6):** AR6 discusses the complexities involved in attributing hydrological changes to climate change, highlighting multiple challenges such as differentiating between natural variability and human-induced changes. It mentions specific examples like increased flood risks due to anthropogenic warming in England and Wales during autumn 2000, which necessitated exhaustive modeling to understand risk ratios due to climate change.

**Extreme Weather Events and Hydrology (Both):** Both documents acknowledge the impact of climate change on extreme hydrological events. AR6 describes how detection of changes in the frequency and magnitude of floods globally is hampered by limited evidence and confounding factors but notes regional increases in heavy precipitation. AR5 elaborates on the ecosystem impacts of floods and droughts, indicating both positive and negative consequences on freshwater habitats depending on the conditions and resilience of the system.

**Precipitation and Evapotranspiration (AR6):** AR6 examines trends in precipitation, noting regional droughts and rainfall patterns and attributing certain trends to both natural variability and anthropogenic influences. It also touches upon evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and permafrost thaw as linked hydrological processes affected by climate change.

**Thermal Habitat Changes and Oxygen Availability (AR5):** AR5 details temperature changes in freshwater bodies, noting global warming's impact on surface water temperatures surpassing sea temperature trends. This section also highlights changes in thermal regimes of lakes and rivers, affecting aquatic habitats and oxygen availability due to reduced mixing and warming.

**Water Level and Ice Cover (AR5):** AR5 outlines variability in water storage in lakes due to climate change, underlining challenges in attribution but noting coherent trends facilitated by long-term data. It also reports on the reduction in ice cover duration in the northern hemisphere, with significant consequences for freshwater systems.

**Streamflow and Groundwater (AR6):** AR6 provides observations on streamflow changes in response to climate warming, consistent with precipitation shifts since the 1950s. It discusses difficulties in attributing groundwater changes to solely climatic factors due to human interference but mentions specific studies linking groundwater level changes to precipitation declines.

**Projected Changes (AR5):** AR5 projects continued warming of freshwater systems and alterations in mixing regimes, with lakes likely experiencing more stratification. River ice duration is expected to decline, further complicating freshwater management due to wide-ranging projections of water storage changes.

In summary, AR6 emphasizes current hydrological changes due to climate change and the challenges in their attribution, while AR5 offers insights on biological and physical dynamics within freshwater systems vis-Ã -vis climate change. Each document presents unique measurements, case studies, and specific observations that highlight the intricate relationship between climate events and hydrological patterns and processes.
