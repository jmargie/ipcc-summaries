Observed Hydrological Changes Due to Climate Change  3.2.1. Detection and Attribution  A documented hydrological change is not necessarily due to anthropogenic climate change. Detection entails showing, usually statistically, that part of the documented change is not due to natural variability of the water cycle (Chapter 18;WGI AR5 Chapter 10). For robust attribution to climatic change, all the drivers of the hydrological change must be identified, with confidence levels assigned to their contributions. Human contributions such as water withdrawals, land use change, and pollution mean that this is usually difficult. Nevertheless, many hydrological impacts can be attributed confidently to their climatic drivers (Table 3-1). End-to-end  attribution, from human climate-altering activities to impacts on freshwater resources, is not attempted in most studies, because it requires experiments with climate models in which the external natural and anthropogenic forcing is “switched off.” However, climate models do not currently simulate the water cycle at fine enough resolution for attribution of most catchment-scale hydrological impacts to anthropogenic climate change. Until climate models and impact models become better integrated, it is necessary to rely heavily on multistep attribution, in which hydrological changes are shown to result from climatic changes that may in turn result partly from human activities.  Extreme hydrological events, such as floods, prompt speculation about whether they are “caused” by climate change. Climate change can indeed alter the probability of a particular event. However, to estimate the alteration reliably it is necessary to quantify uncertainties due to natural variability in the changed and the unchanged climates, and alsobecause of the need for model simulations—uncertainties due to limited ability to simulate the climate.  The probability or risk of the extreme event can be measured by recording the fraction of events beyond some threshold magnitude. Call this fraction rctrl in the simulated actual climate and rexpt in the simulated climate in which there is no anthropogenic forcing, and suppose there are many paired instances of rctrl and rexpt, with the ratio of risks in each pair given by F = rexpt /rctrl. The distribution of risk ratios F describes the likelihood that the climate change has altered the risk. Several thousand pairs of such simulations were run to estimate the risk ratio for the floods in England and Wales in autumn 2000 (Pall et al., 2011). Each pair started from a unique initial state that differed slightly from a common reference state, and was obtained with a seasonal forecast model driven by patterns of attributable warming found beforehand from four climatemodel simulations of the 20th century. The forecast model was coupled to a model of basin-scale runoff and channel-scale hydraulics. It is not probable that such exercises will become routine for assessing singleevent risks in, for example, the insurance industry, because the necessary amount of computation is so formidable. Nevertheless, the result was compelling: in each of the four sets of simulation pairs, the risk increased greatly on average in the runs forced by anthropogenic greenhouse radiation. In aggregate, the most probable amount of increase was twoto threefold, and at most a few percent of the simulation pairs suggested that anthropogenic forcing actually decreased the risk. This summary is worded carefully: the thousands of simulation pairs were needed for quantifying the uncertainties, which led unavoidably to a spread of likelihoods and thus to statements about uncertainty about risk that are themselves uncertain.  3.2.2. Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, Soil Moisture, Permafrost, and Glaciers  Global trends in precipitation from several different datasets during 1901–2005 are statistically insignificant (Bates et al., 2008; WGI AR5 Chapter 2). According to regional observations, most droughts and extreme rainfall events of the 1990s and 2000s have been the worst since the 1950s (Arndt et al., 2010), and certain trends in total and extreme precipitation amounts are observed (WGI AR5 Chapter 2). Most regional changes in precipitation are attributed either to internal variability of the atmospheric circulation or to global warming (Lambert et al., 2004; Stott et al., 2010). It was estimated that the 20th century anthropogenic forcing contributed significantly to observed changes in global and regional precipitation (Zhang et al., 2007). Changes in snowfall amounts are indeterminate, as for precipitation; however, consistent with observed warming, shorter snowfall seasons are observed over most of the Northern Hemisphere, with snowmelt seasons starting earlier  (Takala et al., 2009). In Norway, increased temperature at lower altitudes has reduced the snow water equivalent (Skaugen et al., 2012).  Steady decreases since the 1960s of global and regional actual evapotranspiration and pan evaporation have been attributed to changes in precipitation, diurnal temperature range, aerosol concentration, (net) solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and wind speed (Fu et al., 2009; McVicar et al., 2010; Miralles et al., 2011; Wang A. et al., 2011). Regional downward and upward trends in soil moisture content have been calculated for China from 1950 to 2006, where longer, more severe, and more frequent soil moisture droughts have been experienced over 37% of the land area (Wang A. et al., 2011). This is supported by detected increases since the 1960s in dry days and a prolongation of dry periods (Gemmer et al., 2011; Fischer et al., 2013), and can be attributed to increases in warm days and warm periods (Fischer et al., 2011).  Decreases in the extent of permafrost and increases in its average temperature are widely observed, for example, in some regions of the Arctic and Eurasia (WGI AR5 Chapter 4) and the Andes (Rabassa, 2009). Active layer depth and permafrost degradation are closely dependent on soil ice content. In steep terrain, slope stability is highly affected by changes in permafrost (Harris et al., 2009). The release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to permafrost degradation can have unprecedented impacts on the climate, but these processes are not yet well represented in global climate models (Grosse et al., 2011). In most parts of the world glaciers are losing mass (Gardner et al., 2013). For example, almost all glaciers in the tropical Andes have been shrinking rapidly since the 1980s (Rabassa, 2009; Rabatel et al., 2013); similarly, Himalayan glaciers are losing mass at present (Bolch et al., 2012).  3.2.3. Streamflow  Detected trends in streamflow are generally consistent with observed regional changes in precipitation and temperature since the 1950s. In Europe, streamflow (1962–2004) decreased in the south and east and generally increased elsewhere (Stahl et al., 2010, 2012), particularly in northern latitudes (Wilson et al., 2010). In North America (1951–2002), increases were observed in the Mississippi basin and decreases in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and southern Atlantic–Gulf regions (Kalra et al., 2008). In China, a decrease in streamflow in the Yellow River (19602000) is consistent with a reduction of 12% in summer and autumn precipitation, whereas the Yangtze River shows a small increase in annual streamflow driven by an increase in monsoon rains (Piao et al., 2010; see Table 3-1). These and other streamflow trends must be interpreted with caution (Jones, 2011) because of confounding factors such as land use changes (Zhang and Schilling, 2006), irrigation (Kustu et al., 2010), and urbanization (Wang and Cai, 2010).  In a global analysis of simulated streamflows (1948–2004), about onethird of the top 200 rivers (including the Congo, Mississippi, Yenisei, Paraná, Ganges, Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) showed significant trends in discharge; 45 recorded decreases and only 19 recorded increases (Dai et al., 2009). Decreasing trends in low and mid-latitudes are consistent with recent drying and warming in West Africa, southern Europe, south and east Asia, eastern Australia, western Canada and the USA, and northern South America (Dai, 2013). The contribution to observed streamflow changes due to decreased stomatal opening of many plant species at higher carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration remains disputed (Box CC-VW).  In regions with seasonal snow storage, warming since the 1970s has led to earlier spring discharge maxima (robust evidence, high agreement) and has increased winter flows because more winter precipitation falls as rain instead of snow (Clow, 2010; Korhonen and Kuusisto, 2010; Tan et al., 2011). There is robust evidence of earlier breakup of river ice in Arctic rivers (de Rham et al., 2008; Smith, 2000). Where streamflow is lower in summer, decrease in snow storage has exacerbated summer dryness (Cayan et al., 2001; Knowles et al., 2006).  3.2.4. Groundwater  Attribution of observed changes in groundwater level, storage, or discharge to climatic changes is difficult owing to additional influences of land use changes and groundwater abstractions (Stoll et al., 2011). Observed trends are largely attributable to these additional influences. The extent to which groundwater abstractions have already been affected by climate change is not known. Both detection of changes in groundwater systems and attribution of those changes to climatic changes are rare owing to a lack of appropriate observation wells and a small number of studies. Observed decreases of the discharge of groundwater-fed springs in Kashmir (India) since the 1980s were attributed to observed precipitation decreases (Jeelani, 2008; Table 3-1). A model-based assessment of observed decreases of groundwater levels in four overexploited karst aquifers in Spain led to the conclusion that groundwater recharge not only decreased strongly during the 20th century due to the decreasing precipitation but also that groundwater recharge as a fraction of observed precipitation declined progressively, possibly indicating an increase in evapotranspiration (Aguilera and Murillo, 2009; Table 3-1).  3.2.5. Water Quality  Most observed changes of water quality due to climate change (Table 3-1; Figure 3-2) are known from isolated studies, mostly of rivers or lakes in high-income countries, of a small number of variables. In addition, even though some studies extend over as many as 80 years, most are short term. For lakes and reservoirs, the most frequently reported change is more intense eutrophication and algal blooms at higher temperatures, or shorter hydraulic retention times and higher nutrient loads resulting from increased storm runoff (medium to robust evidence, high agreement). Increased runoff results in greater loads of salts, fecal coliforms, pathogens, and heavy metals (Pednekar et al., 2005; Paerl et al., 2006; Tibby and Tiller, 2007; Boxall et al., 2009) (robust evidence, medium to high agreement, depending on the pollutant). In some cases there are associated impacts on health. For instance, hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness in elderly people increased by 10% when turbidity increased in the raw water of a drinking water plant even when treated using conventional procedures (Schwartz et al., 2000). However, positive impacts were also reported. For example, the risk of eutrophication was reduced when nutrients were flushed from lakes and estuaries by more frequent storms and  hurricanes (Paerl and Huisman, 2008). For rivers, all reported impacts on water quality were negative. Greater runoff, instead of diluting pollution, swept more pollutants from the soil into watercourses (robust evidence, medium to high agreement) (Boxall et al., 2009; Loos et al., 2009; Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010; Gascuel-Odoux et al., 2010; Howden et al., 2010; Saarinen et al., 2010; Tetzlaff et al., 2010; Macleod et al., 2012). Increased organic matter content impaired the quality of conventionally treated drinking water (Weatherhead and Howden, 2009). In streams in semiarid and arid areas, temperature changes had a stronger influence on the increase of organic matter, nitrates, and phosphorus than precipitation changes (Ozaki et al., 2003; Chang, 2004; Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010) (limited evidence, medium agreement). Studies of impacts on groundwater quality are limited and mostly report elevated concentrations of fecal coliforms during the rainy season or after extreme rain events (medium evidence, high agreement), with varying response times (Curriero et al., 2001; Tumwine et al., 2002, 2003; Auld et al., 2004; Jean et al., 2006; Seidu et al., 2013). Given the widespread use of groundwater for municipal supply and minimal or lacking treatment of drinking water in poor regions, increased pollution is a source of concern (Jean et al., 2006; Seidu et al., 2013). Another concern is the nonlinearity (except for temperature) of relationships between water quality and climatic variables (limited evidence, medium agreement). In general, the linkages between observed effects on water quality and climate should be interpreted cautiously and at the local level, considering the type of water body, the pollutant of concern, the hydrological regime, and the many other possible sources of pollution (high confidence; Senhorst and Zwolsman, 2005; Whitehead et al., 2009a; Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010; Howden et al., 2010; Kundzewicz and Krysanova, 2010; Ventela et al., 2011).  3.2.6. Soil Erosion and Sediment Load  Precipitation extremes in many regions have increased since 1950 (Seneviratne et al., 2012), which suggests an increase in rainfall erosivity that would enhance soil erosion and stream sediment loads. A warmer climate may affect soil moisture, litter cover, and biomass production and can bring about a shift in winter precipitation from snow to more erosive rainfall (Kundzewicz et al., 2007) or, in semiarid regions, an increase in wildfires with subsequent rainfall leading to intense erosive events (Nyman et al., 2011; Bussi et al., 2013). The effects of climate change on soil erosion and sediment load are frequently obscured by human agricultural and management activities (Walling, 2009).  Only few studies have isolated the contribution of climate change to observed trends in soil erosion and sediment load. In the Yellow River basin, where soil erosion results mostly from heavy rainfall, reduced precipitation (~10%) contributed about 30% to a total reduction in stream sediment loads reaching the sea during 2000–2005, compared to 1950–1968, with the remaining 70% attributable to sediment trapping in reservoirs and soil conservation measures (Wang et al., 2007; Miao et al., 2011). Dai et al. (2008), analyzing the decrease in sediment load of the Yangtze River over 1956–2002, found that climate change was responsible for an increase of about 3 ± 2%; most of the decline in its lower reaches was due to dam construction (Three Gorges Dam) and soil conservation measures. Potential impacts of climate change on soil erosion and sediment production are of concern in regions with pronounced glacier retreat (Walling, 2009). Glacial rivers are expected to discharge more meltwater, which may increase sediment loads. However, the limited evidence is inconclusive for a global diagnosis of sediment load changes; there are both decreasing (e.g., Iceland; Lawler et al., 2003) and increasing trends (Patagonia; Fernandez et al., 2011). So far, there is no clear evidence that the frequency or magnitude of shallow landslides has changed over past decades (Huggel et al., 2012), even in regions with relatively complete event records (e.g., Switzerland; Hilker et al., 2009). Increased landslide impacts (measured by casualties or losses) in south and Southeast Asia, where landslides are triggered predominantly by monsoon and tropical cyclone activity, are largely attributed to population growth leading to increased exposure (Petley, 2012).  In summary, there is limited evidence and low agreement that anthropogenic climate change has made a significant contribution to soil erosion, sediment loads, and landslides. The available records are limited in space and time, and evidence suggests that, in most cases, the impacts of land use and land cover changes are more significant than those of climate change.  3.2.7. Extreme Hydrological Events and their Impacts  There is low confidence, due to limited evidence, that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of floods at global scale (Kundzewicz et al., 2013). The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, in the attribution of detected changes it is difficult to distinguish the roles of climate and human activities (Section 3.2.1). However, recent detection of trends in extreme precipitation and discharge in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding at regional scale (medium confidence). More locations show increases in heavy precipitation than decreases (Seneviratne et al., 2012). Flood damage costs worldwide have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly due to increasing exposure of people and assets (Handmer et al., 2012).  There is no strong evidence for trends in observed flooding in the USA (Hirsch and Ryberg, 2012), Europe (Mudelsee et al., 2003; Stahl et al., 2010; Benito and Machado, 2012; Hannaford and Hall, 2012), South America, and Africa (Conway et al., 2009). However, at smaller spatial scales, an increase in annual maximum discharge has been detected in parts of northwestern Europe (Petrow and Merz, 2009; Giuntoli et al., 2012; Hattermann et al., 2012), while a decrease was observed in southern France (Giuntoli et al., 2012). Flood discharges in the lower Yangtze basin increased over the last 40 years (Jiang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009), and both upward and downward trends were identified in four basins in the northwestern Himalaya (Bhutiyani et al., 2008). In Australia, only 30% of 491 gauge stations showed trends at the 10% significance level, with decreasing magnitudes in southern regions and increasing magnitudes in the northern regions (Ishak et al., 2010). In Arctic rivers dominated by a snowmelt regime, there is no general trend in flood magnitude and frequency (Shiklomanov et al., 2007). In Nordic countries, significant changes since the mid-20th century are mostly toward earlier seasonal flood peaks, but flood magnitudes show  contrasting trends, driven by temperature and precipitation, in basins with and without glaciers increasing peaks in the former and decreasing peaks in the latter (Wilson et al., 2010; Dahlke et al., 2012). Significant trends at almost one-fifth of 160 stations in Canada were reported, most of them decreases in snowmelt-flood magnitudes (Cunderlik and Ouarda, 2009). Similar decreases were found for spring and annual maximum flows (Burn et al., 2010).  Attribution has been addressed by Hattermann et al. (2012), who identified parallel trends in precipitation extremes and flooding in Germany, which for the increasing winter floods are explainable in terms of increasing frequency and persistence of circulation patterns favorable to flooding (Petrow et al., 2009). It is very likely that the observed intensification of heavy precipitation is largely anthropogenic (Min et al., 2011; see also Section 3.2.1).  Socioeconomic losses from flooding are increasing (high confidence), although attribution to anthropogenic climate change is established only seldom (Pall et al., 2011). Reported flood damages (adjusted for inflation) have increased from an average of US$7 billion per year in the 1980s to about US$24 billion per year in 2011 (Kundzewicz et al., 2013). Economic, including insured, flood disaster losses are higher in developed countries, while fatality rates and economic losses expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product are higher in developing countries. Since 1970, the annual number of flood-related deaths has been in the thousands, with more than 95% in developing countries (Handmer et al., 2012). There is high confidence (medium evidence, high agreement) that greater exposure of people and assets, and societal factors related to population and economic growth, contributed to the increased losses (Handmer et al., 2012; Kundzewicz et al., 2013). When damage records are normalized for changes in exposure and vulnerability (Bouwer, 2011), most studies find no contribution of flooding trends to the trend in losses (Barredo, 2009; Hilker et al., 2009; Benito and Machado, 2012), although there are exceptions (Jiang et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2009).  Assessments of observed changes in “drought” depend on the definition of drought (meteorological, agricultural, or hydrological) and the chosen drought index (e.g., consecutive dry days, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Runoff Index (SRI); see Seneviratne et al., 2012). Meteorological (rainfall) and agricultural (soil moisture) droughts have become more frequent since 1950 (Seneviratne et al., 2012) in some regions, including southern Europe and western Africa, but in others (including the southern USA; Chen et al., 2012) there is no evidence of change in frequency (WGI AR5 Chapter 2).  Very few studies have considered variations over time in hydrological (streamflow) drought, largely because there are few long records from catchments without direct human interventions. A trend was found toward lower summer minimum flows for 1962–2004 in small catchments in southern and Eastern Europe, but there was no clear trend in northern or Western Europe (Stahl et al., 2010). Models can reproduce observed patterns of drought occurrence (e.g., Prudhomme et al., 2011), but as with climate models their outputs can be very divergent. In simulations of drought at the global scale in 1963–2000 with an ensemble of hydrological models, strong correlations were noted between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and hydrological droughts, andparticularly in dry regions—low correlations between meteorological and hydrological droughts, which suggests that hydrological droughts cannot necessarily be inferred from rainfall deficits (van Huijgevoort et al., 2013).
