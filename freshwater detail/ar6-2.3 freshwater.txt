2.3.3 Biologically Important Physical Changes in Freshwater Systems  Physical changes are fundamental drivers of change at all levels of biological organisation, from individual species, to communities, whole ecosystems. The climate hazards specific to freshwater systems not documented elsewhere in AR6 are summarised here.  2.3.3.1 Observed Change in Thermal Habitat and Oxygen Availability  Since AR5, evidence of changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers has continued to increase. Global warming rates for lake surface waters were estimated as 0.21°C–0.45°C per decade between 1970 and 2010, exceeding sea-surface temperature (SST) trends of 0.09°C per decade between 1980 and 2017 (robust evidence, high agreement) (Figure 2.2; (Schneider and Hook, 2010; Kraemer et al., 2015; O’Reilly et al., 2015; Woolway et al., 2020b). Warming of lake surface water temperatures was variable within regions (O’Reilly et al., 2015) but more homogeneous than deep-water temperature changes (Pilla et al., 2020). Because temperature trends in lakes can vary vertically, horizontally and seasonally, complex changes have occurred in the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms at particular depths and temperatures (Kraemer et al., 2021).  

Changes in river water temperatures ranged from −1.21°C to +1.076°C per decade between 1901 and 2010 (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Hari et al., 2006; Kaushal et al., 2010; Jurgelėnaitė et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Latkovska and Apsīte, 2016; Marszelewski and Pius, 2016). The more rapid increase in surface water temperature in lakes and rivers in regions with cold winters (O’Reilly et al., 2015) can, in part, be attributed to the amplified warming in polar and high-latitude regions (robust evidence, high agreement) (Screen and Simmonds, 2010; Stuecker et al., 2018).  Shifts in thermal regime: Since AR5, the trend that lake waters mix less frequently continues (Butcher et al., 2015; Adrian et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2017; Woolway et al., 2017). This results from greater warming of surface temperatures relative to deep-water temperatures, and the loss of ice during winter which prevents inverse thermal stratification in north temperate lakes (robust evidence, high agreement) (Adrian et al., 2009; Winslow et al., 2015; Adrian et al., 2016; Schwefel et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2017).  Oxygen availability: increased water temperature and reduced mixing cause a decrease in dissolved oxygen. In 400 lakes, dissolved oxygen in surface and deep waters declined by 4.1 and 16.8%, respectively, between 1980 and 2017 (Jane et al., 2021). The deepest water layers are expected to experience an increase in hypoxic conditions by >25% due to fewer complete mixing events, with strong repercussions for nutrient dynamics and the loss of thermal habitat (robust evidence, high agreement) (Straile et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015; Schwefel et al., 2016).  2.3.3.2 Observed Changes in Water Level  Depending on how the intensification of the global water cycle affects individual lake water budgets, the amount of water stored in specific lakes may increase, decrease or have no substantial cumulative effect (Notaro et al., 2015; Pekel et al., 2016; Rodell et al., 2018; Busker et al., 2019; Woolway et al., 2020b). The magnitude of hydrological changes that can be assuredly attributed to climate change remains uncertain (Hegerl et al., 2015; Gronewold and Rood, 2019; Kraemer et al., 2020). Attribution of water storage variation in lakes due to climate change is facilitated when such variations occur coherently across broad geographic regions and long time scales, preferably absent of other anthropogenic hydrological influences (Watras et al., 2014; Kraemer et al., 2020). There is increasing awareness that climate change contributes to the loss of small temporary ponds which cover a greater global area than lakes (Bagella et al., 2016).  Lakes fed by glacial melt water are growing in response to climate change and glacier retreat (robust evidence, high agreement) (Shugar etal., 2020).Water storage increases on theTibetan Plateau (Figure2.3a) have been attributed to changes in glacier melt, permafrost thaw, precipitation and runoff, in part as a result of climate change (Huang et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a). High confidence in attribution of these trends to climate change is supported by long-term ground survey data and observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (Ma et al., 2010; Rodell et al., 2018; Kraemer et al., 2020).  In the Arctic, lake area has increased in regions with continuous permafrost, and decreased in regions where permafrost is thinner and discontinuous (robust evidence, high agreement) (See Chapter 4) (Smith et al., 2005; Andresen and Lougheed, 2015; Nitze et al., 2018; Mekonnen et al., 2021).

2.3.3.3 Observed Changes in Discharge  Analysis of river flows from 7250 observatories around the world covering the years 1971–2010 and identified spatially complex patterns, with reductions in northeastern Brazil, southern Australia and the Mediterranean, and increases in northern Europe (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Gudmundsson et al., 2021). More than half of global rivers undergo periodic drying that reduces river connectivity (medium evidence, medium agreement). Increased frequency and intensity of droughts may cause perennial rivers to become intermittent and intermittent rivers to disappear (medium evidence, medium agreement), threatening freshwater fish in habitats already characterised by heat and droughts (Datry etal.,2016;Schneider et al., 2017; Jaric et al., 2019). In high-altitude/latitude streams, reduced glacier and snowpack extent, earlier snowmelt and altered precipitation patterns, attributed to climate change, have increased flow intermittency (Siebers et al., 2019; Gudmundsson et al., 2021). Patterns in flow regimes can be directly linked to a variety of processes shaping freshwater biodiversity, so any climate change-induced changes in flow regimes and river connectivity are expected to alter species composition as well as having societal impacts (See Chapter 3 in (IPCC, 2018b)) (Bunn and Arthington, 2002; Thomson et al., 2012; Chessman, 2015; Kakouei et al., 2018).  2.3.3.4 Observed Loss of Ice  Studies since AR5 have confirmed ongoing and accelerating loss of lake and river ice in the Northern Hemisphere (robust evidence, high agreement) (Figure 2.4). In recent decades, systems have been freezing later in winter and thawing earlier in spring, reducing ice duration by >2weeks per year and leading to an increasing numbers of years with a loss of perennial ice cover, intermittent ice cover or even an absence of ice (Adrian et al., 2009; Kirillin et al., 2012; Paquette et al., 2015; Adrian et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2019). The global extent of river ice declined by 25% between 1984 and 2018 (Yang et al., 2020). This trend has been more pronounced at higher latitudes, consistent with enhanced polar warming (large geographic coverage) (Du et al., 2017). Empirical long-term and remote-sensing data gathered in an increasingly large number of freshwater systems supports very high confidence in attributing these trends to climate

change. For the decline of glaciers, snow and permafrost, see Chapter 4 (this report) and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC, 2019b).  2.3.3.5 Extreme Weather Events and Freshwater Systems  Since AR5, numerous drastic short-term responses have been observed in lakes and rivers, to both expected seasonal extreme events and unexpected supra-seasonal extremes extending over multiple seasons. Consequences for ecosystem functioning are not well understood (Bogan etal., 2015; Death etal., 2015; Stockwell etal., 2020). Increasing frequencies of severe floods and droughts attributed to climate change are major threats for river ecosystems (Peters et al., 2016; Alfieri et al., 2017). While extreme floods cause massive physical disturbance, moderate floods can have positive effects, providing woody debris that contributes to habitat complexity and diversity, flushing fine sediments, dissolving organic carbon and providing important food sources from terrestrial origins (Peters et al., 2016; Talbot et al., 2018). Droughts reduce river habitat diversity and connectivity, threatening aquatic species, especially in deserts and arid regions (Bogan et al., 2015; Death et al., 2015; Ledger and Milner, 2015; Jaric et al., 2019).  Rivers already under stress from human activities such as urban development and farming on floodplains are prone to reduced resilience to future extreme events (medium confidence) (Woodward et al., 2016; Talbot et al., 2018). Thus, the potential for floods to become catastrophic for ecosystem services is exacerbated by LULCC (Peters et al., 2016; Talbot et al., 2018). However, biota can recover rapidly from extreme flood events if river geomorphology is not greatly altered. If instream habitat is strongly affected, recovery, if it occurs, takes much longer, resulting in a decline of biodiversity (medium confidence) (Thorp et al., 2010; Death et al., 2015; Poff et al., 2018).  However, not all extreme events will have a biological impact, depending, in particular, on the timing, magnitude and frequency of events and the antecedent conditions (Bailey and van de Pol, 2016; Stockwell et al., 2020; Jennings et al., 2021; Thayne et al., 2021). For instance, an extreme wind event may have little impact on phytoplankton in a lake that was fully mixed prior to the event. Conversely, the effects of a storm on phytoplankton communities may compound when lakes have not yet recovered from a previous storm or if periods of drought alternate with periods of intense precipitation (limited evidence) (Leonard et al., 2014; Stockwell et al., 2020).  In summary, extreme events (heat waves, storms and loss of ice) affect lakes in terms of water temperature, water level, light, oxygen concentrations and nutrient dynamics, which, in turn, affect primary production, fish communities and GHG emissions (high confidence). These impacts are modified by levels of solar radiation, wind speed and precipitation (Woolway et al., 2020a). Droughts have a negative impact on water quality in streams and lakes by increasing water temperature, salinity, the frequency of algal blooms and contaminant concentrations, and reducing concentrations of nutrients and dissolved oxygen (medium confidence) (Peters et al., 2016; Alfieri et al., 2017; Woolway et al., 2020a). Understanding how these pressures subsequently cascade through freshwater ecosystems will be essential  for future projections of their resistance and resilience towards extreme events (Leonard et al., 2014; Stockwell et al., 2020). See Table SM2.1 for specific examples of observed changes.  2.3.3.6 Projected Changes in Physical Characteristics of Lakes and Rivers  Given the strength of relationship between past GSAT and warming trends at lake surfaces (Figure 2.2; Section 2.3.3.1) and projected increases in heat waves, surface water temperatures are projected to continue to increase (Woolway et al., 2021). Mean May to October lake surface temperatures in 46,557 European lakes were projected to be 2.9°C, 4.5°C and 6.5°C warmer by 2081–2099 compared to the historic period (1981–1999) under RCP2.0, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, respectively (Woolway et al., 2020a). Under RCP2.6, the average intensity of lake heat waves increases from 3.7°C to 4.0°C and the average duration from 7.7 to 27.0 days, relative to the historic period (1970–1999). For RCP8.5, warming increases to 5.4°C and duration increases dramatically to 95.5 days (medium confidence) (Woolway et al., 2021).  Worldwide alterations in lake mixing regimes in response to climate change are projected (Kirillin, 2010). Most prominently, monomictic lakes—undergoing one mixing event in most years—will become permanently stratified, while lakes that are currently dimictic—mixing twice per year—will become monomictic by 2080–2100 (medium confidence) (Woolway and Merchant, 2019). Nevertheless, predicting mixing behaviour remains an important challenge and attribution to climate change remains difficult (Schwefel et al., 2016; Bruce et al., 2018).  Under climate projections of 3.2°C warming, 4.6% of the ice-covered lakes in the Northern Hemisphere could switch to intermittent winter ice cover (Figure 2.4a; (Sharma et al., 2019). Unfrozen and warmer lakes lose more water to evaporation (Wang et al., 2018b). By 2100, global annual lake evaporation will increase by 16%, relative to 20062015, under RCP8.5 (Woolway et al., 2020b). Moreover, melting of ice decreases the ratio of sensible to latent heat flux, thus channelling more energy into evaporation (medium confidence) (Wang et al., 2018b). In the periods 2009–2029 and 2080–2100, average duration of river ice is projected to decline by 7.3 and 16.7 days under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Figure 2.4b; (Yang et al., 2020).  Projections of lake water storage are limited by the absence of reliable, long-term, homogenous and spatially resolved hydrologic observations (Hegerl et al., 2015). This uncertainty is reflected in the widely divergent projections in response to future climate changes in individual lakes (Angel and Kunkel, 2010; MacKay and Seglenieks, 2012; Malsy et al., 2012; Notaro et al., 2015) . Selecting models that perform well when comparing hindcasted to observed past water storage variation often does little to reduce water storage projection uncertainty (Angel and Kunkel, 2010). This wide range of potential changes complicates lake management. For information on observed and projected changes in the global water cycle and hydrological regimes for streams, lakes, wetland, groundwater and their implications on water quality and societies, see Chapter 4, this report, and (Douville et al., 2021). For the role of weather and climate extremes on the global water cycle, see (Seneviratne et al., 2021). In summary, with ongoing climate warming and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, observed increases in water temperature, losses of ice and shifts in thermal regime are projected to continue (high confidence).
