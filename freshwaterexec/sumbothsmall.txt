prompt: Write a comparative summary of these two documents, aimed at college-educated readers who are not scientists. make sure to mention details which are only in one document:
In comparing Chapter 3 on Freshwater Resources and Chapter 2 on Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems and Their Services, both documents address climate change impacts but focus on different aspects and present distinct findings regarding adaptation strategies.

**Key Risks and Observed Impacts**: Chapter 3 emphasizes the significant risks to freshwater resources due to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as reduced renewable water resources, increased frequency of droughts, and threats to water quality. Notably, it projects significant impacts on regions with snowfall and glacier-fed rivers. Chapter 2, however, focuses on the broader spectrum of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, highlighting observed impacts like range shifts in species, increased wildlife diseases, and biome shifts. It points out that half of the assessed species have shifted their ranges, and two-thirds of spring phenological events have advanced.

**Unique Details**: Chapter 3 provides granular details on the percentage of the global population affected by reduced water resources and the number of people exposed to flooding under different emission scenarios. It also discusses the interaction between water consumption sectors competing for shrinking resources. Chapter 2 presents unique insights into the role of climate change in exacerbating wildlife diseases and local population extinctions, with data showing its higher impact on tropical areas and freshwater habitats. Chapter 2 also emphasizes the underestimated complexity of biological responses to climate change in previous reports.

**Adaptation and Sustainable Development**: Chapter 3 discusses adaptive approaches to water management, suggesting techniques like scenario planning and emphasizing the necessity of groundwater abstraction to counteract variability in surface water availability. It notes that adaptive capacity is hindered by limited institutional and financial resources, especially in developing countries. Chapter 2, on the other hand, underlines the need for adaptation measures to focus on ecosystem integrity and function. It highlights the importance of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) as part of nature-based solutions (NbS), stressing the importance of involving local and Indigenous knowledge in implementing these measures.

**Projected Risks**: Chapter 3 projects risks related to water scarcity and quality due to increases in temperature and precipitation variabilities. Chapter 2 details broader risks including species extinctions and biome shifts, with significant impacts expected in regions like northern South America and southern Africa. It highlights the potential transformation of the Amazon rainforest into a drier ecosystem and the shift of boreal forests into the Arctic tundra.

**Urgency and Implementation**: Both chapters emphasize the critical need for immediate action. Chapter 3 points out that most adaptation costs will occur in developing countries, highlighting the urgency of anticipatory adaptation. Chapter 2 stresses that adaptation strategies must be swift due to the increasing frequency of extreme events and urges incorporating sustainable practices, such as those advocated by Indigenous communities.

In conclusion, while both chapters discuss climate impacts and adaptations, Chapter 3 focuses specifically on freshwater issues and their management, while Chapter 2 provides a holistic overview of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, underscoring the interconnected nature of climate impacts across ecosystems and the importance of inclusive adaptation strategies. Both advocate for deep GHG emission reductions and highlight the necessity of immediate and adaptable responses.
