The Executive Summary of Chapter 2 discusses the global assessment of climate change impacts and risks on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, their species, and the services they provide to humanity. The chapter delineates observed impacts, projected risks, and adaptation measures for these ecosystems.

**Observed Impacts:** 
Climate change is affecting species ranges, phenology, physiology, and morphology due to increased frequency and severity of extreme events. Vulnerable ecosystems and species are experiencing the most severe impacts. Notably, exotic species are better adapting compared to native ones, leading to new invasions. Freshwater ecosystems are seeing rising water temperatures, reduced ice cover, and changes in dissolved oxygen, affecting species and primary productivity. Increased wildlife diseases and local population extinctions are linked to climate change, with genetic evolution noted but insufficient to prevent species extinction if climate conditions shift drastically.

**Projected Risks:** 
Rising global temperatures are expected to result in species extinctions, biome shifts, and increased wildfire areas. The median extinction risk intensifies with temperature rise, significantly impacting ecosystem integrity and functions. High warming scenarios project significant biodiversity losses in regions like northern South America and southern Africa, alongside biome shifts in the Amazon and boreal forests. Increased wildfires are expected, especially in regions with previously low fire frequencies, compounding the risks to ecosystems and water supplies.

**Adaptation Options and Solutions:** 
Adaptation measures, including the protection and restoration of ecosystems, offer resilience against climate impacts. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) provides climate change adaptation and biodiversity benefits. NbS (Nature-based Solutions) should be implemented with attention to governance and inclusive of Indigenous and local knowledge to avoid maladaptation. Natural ecosystems offer crucial carbon storage and biodiversity services. Still, some mitigation strategies, like monoculture planting, pose maladaptive risks. Integrating adaptation strategies with sustainable development is vital for human health and economic stability while avoiding maladaptation and focusing on ecosystem restoration, habitat connectivity, and microclimate protection.

**Climate Resilient Development:** 
Effective conservation of Earth's surface is critical to maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services under climate stress. Additionally, adaptive management must consider climate impacts on species distributions and ecological processes, requiring proactive measures. Engaging Indigenous knowledge can greatly enhance adaptation strategies. Natural ecosystems provide carbon sequestration and other vital services, offering powerful climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions if combined with substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions.

Overall, chapter advocates for urgent and coordinated actions to safeguard ecosystems and communities relying on them, investing in both adaptation strategies and cutting emissions to limit climate-related risks.
