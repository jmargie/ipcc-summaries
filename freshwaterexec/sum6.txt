prompt: 'Please summarize the following document:'
The document discusses the risks associated with freshwater resources under the impact of climate change, emphasizing the connections to global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Key points include:

1. **Risk from Climate Change:** With higher GHG emissions, the risks to freshwater resources increase significantly, affecting renewable water sources, flooding, and droughts. For each degree of global warming, significant decreases in renewable water availability are projected, affecting about 7% of the global population.

2. **Regional Variability:** Dry subtropical regions will experience reduced surface and groundwater resources, heightening competition for water. Conversely, high-latitude regions may see increased water resources.

3. **Floods and Droughts:** While there is no widespread data on increased flood magnitude due to climate change, certain areas are projected to experience increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts, exacerbating socioeconomic impacts.

4. **Ecosystem Impact:** Freshwater ecosystems face adverse effects due to changes in streamflow and water quality, with more pronounced impacts in areas with water withdrawals and reservoir construction.

5. **Water Quality Risks:** Climate change is expected to degrade raw water quality due to factors like increased pollutants and treatment disruptions from flooding.

6. **Glacial and Snowmelt Changes:** Changes in glacier-fed river systems are expected to shift peak discharges from summer to spring, impacting water availability in those regions.

7. **Adaptive Strategies:** Adaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial, especially in developing countries. Approaches include scenario planning and developing flexible solutions, though barriers like financial and institutional capacity remain.

8. **Challenges in Mitigation:** Some measures to reduce GHGs, like bioenergy crops and hydropower, pose risks to freshwater systems, necessitating careful management to balance benefits and impacts.

Overall, the executive summary highlights the need for adaptative water management strategies and innovative solutions to mitigate and adapt to the evolving challenges posed by climate change on global freshwater resources.
