Summary and Comparison of Documents on Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems and Resources

Chapter 2: Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems and Their Services

- Observed Impacts: Climate change has significantly impacted terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems globally, altering species' ranges, phenology, and physiology. Vulnerable species and ecosystems are experiencing the most severe impacts due to extreme weather events and climate shifts. Freshwater ecosystems have seen increases in water temperature, reduced ice cover, and changes in hydrology, affecting water quality and biological communities. Wildlife diseases have been more prevalent, with pests expanding into new regions. Local extinctions have been noted across various species, especially in tropical and freshwater habitats. Ecosystem structural changes and range shifts have been observed, such as forest encroachment into grasslands.

- Projected Risks: Climate change threatens species with extinction, biome shifts, and increased wildfire susceptibility. At higher warming scenarios, significant shifts in major ecosystems like the Amazon and boreal forests are predicted. Wildfires and carbon release from ecosystems present substantial future risks.

- Adaptation Measures: Human-led efforts to enhance ecosystem resilience include ecosystem protection, restoration, and the application of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Adaptation should include habitat connectivity and protecting ecological refugia. Despite the adaptation potential, significant GHG emission reductions remain critical.

- Climate Resilient Development: Natural ecosystem conservation is essential for climate adaptation. Indigenous knowledge systems play a key role in successful adaptation strategies. Long-term adaptation efforts must be paired with swift mitigation action.

Chapter 3: Freshwater Resources

- Key Risks at the Global Scale: Increasing GHG concentrations exacerbate freshwater scarcity, impacting water security and contributing to significant regional variability. Water resources are projected to diminish in dry subtropical areas while increasing at higher latitudes. Although current observations on flood frequency due to climate change are limited, projections suggest increasing flood hazards, particularly in certain global regions.

- Impacts on Freshwater Systems: Climate change is expected to lower raw water quality through increased sediment and nutrient loads. Changes in snowfall and glaciers will alter streamflow seasonality. There are anticipated changes to soil erosion and sediment load due to increased heavy rainfall and temperature.

- Adaptation, Mitigation, and Sustainable Development: Adaptation is urgently needed in developing countries, which face significant costs. Adaptive water management strategies are critical but face barriers like limited capacity and financial resources. Measures that aim to reduce GHG emissions can pose risks to freshwater systems, highlighting the need for integrated management approaches.

Comparison:

Both chapters underscore climate change's broad impacts on ecosystems and the necessity for robust adaptation measures across terrestrial, freshwater, and ecosystem services. Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems (Chapter 2) emphasize the impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services, focusing on observed species changes and the need for ecosystem-based resilience strategies. Freshwater Resources (Chapter 3) highlight water-specific risks, including water scarcity, quality issues, and altered hydrological patterns, with an emphasis on adaptive management and sustainable development within the water sector. Adaptation in both domains requires integrating local and Indigenous knowledge to maximize resilience and sustainable management practices. While Chapter 2 discusses broad ecosystem services and biodiversity, Chapter 3 focuses on freshwater-specific issues related to water security, quality, and governance. Ultimately, both documents converge on the urgency of reducing GHG emissions, protecting natural systems, and implementing coordinated adaptation to secure ecosystem integrity and human well-being in the face of climate change.

There’s a strong emphasis on terrestrial species' range shifts, genetic evolution observations, and extreme event impacts leading to shifts beyond current ecological and evolutionary adaptation capacities.

In contrast, 'Chapter 3' specifically targets freshwater resources, discussing changes in renewable water resources, streamflow seasonality, and glacial meltwater yields. It highlights competition for water among various sectors, increase in meteorological and agricultural droughts in dry regions, and potential shifts in peak discharge patterns in glacier-fed rivers.

**Risks:**

Both chapters mention the increased extinction risks for species and fundamental disruptions to ecosystem services. 'Chapter 2' projects risks including biome shifts, increased wildfire areas, and ecosystem changes leading to reduced integrity and resilience. The chapter underlines risks to biodiversity globally, hinging heavily on temperature rise scenarios.

'Chapter 3' focuses on risks related to water scarcity and quality. It notes the effects of decreased renewable water resources, increased flood hazards, and altered water quality as a result of climate change. The chapter assesses how emissions scenarios profoundly affect future risks, emphasizing regional impact disparities.

**Adaptation Measures:**

Adaptation strategies in both documents focus on resilience and ecosystem management. 'Chapter 2' suggests ecosystem restoration, maintaining habitat connectivity, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) which includes creating refugia and promoting biodiversity. It stresses the role of EbA in providing mitigation co-benefits and the need for deeper emission cuts alongside adaptation.

'Chapter 3' proposes adaptive water management techniques, highlighting groundwater abstraction enhancement and scenario planning as responses to uncertainty in water availability. The focus is on building human and institutional capacity, with barriers identified such as resource constraints.

**Unique Details:**

- 'Chapter 2' uniquely addresses the adaptability of exotic species compared to natives, the role of evolutionary processes in species' responses to climate change, and vulnerability specificities across different species and biomes.

- 'Chapter 3' includes projections regarding socioeconomic impacts of water resource stresses, specifically droughts and floods, and their implications on food, energy, and water security. It also points out opportunities and barriers in adaptive water management and potential risks of maladaptive GHG mitigation measures on freshwater systems.

In conclusion, while both chapters underscore the critical nature of climate change impacts and adaptation needs, 'Chapter 2' presents a broader ecological perspective inclusive of terrestrial systems, whereas 'Chapter 3' narrows down to water-specific challenges and strategic responses. Each provides a detailed analysis pertinent to its focus, with 'Chapter 2' more centered on biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and 'Chapter 3' on water resource management and regional hydrological risks.
